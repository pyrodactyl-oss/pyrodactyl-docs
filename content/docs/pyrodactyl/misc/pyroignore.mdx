# What is a .pyroignore file?

The `.pyroignore` file is Pyrodactyl's version of the `.pteroignore` file. It allows you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from server backups. When you create a backup, Pyrodactyl reads this file and skips any files or directories that match the patterns defined within.

## How it works

The `.pyroignore` file should be placed in the root directory of your server. Each line in the file represents a pattern to exclude from backups.

## Pattern matching

- **Directory paths**: Exclude entire directories and their contents
- **File paths**: Exclude specific files
- **Wildcards**: Use `*` to match multiple characters
- **Trailing slash**: Including a `/` at the end specifically targets directories

## Examples

### Basic server exclusion
```
plugins/dynmap
logs/
cache/
```

### Advanced patterns
```
# Exclude all log files
*.log

# Exclude specific file types
*.tmp
*.cache

# Exclude entire directories
plugins/Dynmap/
plugins/WorldEdit/

# Exclude specific files
server.properties
banned-players.json

# Use wildcards for partial matches
temp*.*
*_backup/
```

### Common use cases

#### Minecraft servers
```
# Large plugins that don't need backup
plugins/dynmap/
plugins/WorldEdit/cache/

# Log files
logs/
*.log

# Temporary files
cache/
*.tmp
```

#### General exclusions
```
# Configuration that doesn't change frequently
config.yml
settings.json

# Large data directories
data/cache/
temp/

# Development files
.git/
node_modules/
```

## Tips

1. **Place it in your server root** - The file must be in the main server directory
2. **One pattern per line** - Each line is treated as a separate exclusion pattern
3. **Comments are supported** - Use `#` at the beginning of a line to add comments
4. **Test your patterns** - Create a test backup to verify your exclusions work correctly
5. **Be specific** - Avoid overly broad patterns that might exclude important files

## Limitations

- The `.pyroignore` file only affects backups, not file operations in the live server
- Patterns are matched against the full file path from the server root
- Some system files may always be excluded regardless of the `.pyroignore` file
