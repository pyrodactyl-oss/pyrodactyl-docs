This comprehensive guide walks you through setting up Pyrodactyl using Docker, from scratch to a fully functional system.

<Callout type="note">
  The guide for migration has moved to a [new page](/docs/migrations).

## Prerequisites

- Linux system with root access
- Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Experience with Docker and basic system administration skills
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

## Panel Installation

1. Download and configure the docker-compose file [(template)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrodactyl-oss/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml).

   - Modify all placeholder variables under `x-common`
   - Adjust exposed ports if needed (add 443 if you want to use HTTPS)

1. Create a new folder (e.g. pyrodactyl-panel) on your server in a safe location, and move or upload your edited compose file into it. Rename the file to docker-compose.yml.

1. In terminal, cd into the directory, and run the following command to start the panel:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

1. Run the command below, and go through its prompts to create an admin user:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
   ```

1. Check that the panel is accessible using the IP address or domain of your server.

## Panel Configuration

1. Access the panel via your server's IP/domain and login to your previously created user
1. Navigate to admin panel (three dots menu → Admin)
1. Navigate to Locations, make a new location. It can have any name
1. Navigate to Nodes, create a new node

   - FQDN is the domain or IP address (if you're not using HTTPS) of the server you're going to use as a backend
   - You should make sure the daemon ports are free on your backend server

1. On the new node, go to the:
   - Configuration tab: Copy the contents to /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml on your backend server
   - Allocation tab: Add some allocations to use for your servers. The IP should be 0.0.0.0. If you want to show a different IP in the UI (e.g. a subdomain), add an alias. You can input a range of ports like 25565-26000

## Elytra Installation

<Callout type="info">
As of release 5.0, Pyrodactyl is compatible with both [Pterodactyl Wings](https://pterodactyl.io/wings/1.0/installing.html) and [Pyro Inc.&copy; Elytra](/docs/elytra).
You can find info to install at [Elytra Docs](/docs/elytra/installation)
</Callout>


## Post-Installation Steps

### Email Configuration

For user password reset emails, etc, you'll need an SMTP server. For this, you can use:

- [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- [Mailersend](https://www.mailersend.com/)
- [Maddy](https://maddy.email)

You can configure SFTP settings in Admin Panel → Settings.

### DDoS protection

If you're planning to have your server publicly accessible, your server could be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Although not covered here due to its complexity, consider using:

- [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
- [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/)

The goal is to not have your server's IP address on any of your known domains.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise:

1. Test with vanilla Pterodactyl by changing panel image to `ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest`
1. Debug issues
1. Switch back to Pyrodactyl image when resolved
